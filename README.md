# Artboard

A small keyboard design for those who cannot or prefer not use 'traditional' keyboard designs. This keyboard is inspired by [The Paintbrush](https://github.com/artseyio/thepaintbrush)

*This project aims to create a small keyboard design that is adaptable and flexible. Especially for those with disabilities, those who cannot type on traditional keyboads and those that prefer not use traditional keyboards.*



## What

A small keyboard hardware design that can be built free of charge for non-commercial use. The design is meant to be used with systems like [ARTSEY.IO](https://www.artsey.io/).

We also work to have our hardware supported by well known open source keyboard firmware projects to make them easier to setup and use.


## Who

I'm a software engineer by trade. I hurt my right elbow (tennis elbow) and have been looking for a one-handed keyboard so I can rest my right arm so it can hopefully heal faster.
